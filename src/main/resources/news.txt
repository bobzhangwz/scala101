Many older people are being "airbrushed" out of coronavirus figures in the UK, charities have warned.

The official death toll has been criticised for only covering people who die in hospital - but not those in care homes or in their own houses.

It comes after the government confirmed there had been virus outbreaks at more than 2,000 care homes in England.

Meanwhile, scientific advisers for the government will meet later to review the UK's coronavirus lockdown measures.

The evaluation will be passed to the government - but ministers have said it was unlikely restrictions would change.

On Monday, the UK's chief medical adviser said he would like "much more extensive testing" in care homes due to the "large numbers of vulnerable people" there.

Prof Chris Whitty told the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing on that 92 homes in the UK reported outbreaks in one day.

The Department of Health and Social Care later confirmed 2,099 care homes in England have so far had cases of the virus.

The figures prompted the charity Age UK to claim coronavirus is "running wild" in care homes for elderly people.

"The current figures are airbrushing older people out like they don't matter," Caroline Abrahams, the charity's director, said.

The Office for National Statistics is due to release new figures on the number of deaths involving coronavirus at 09:30 BST, which include every community death linked to Covid-19 in England and Wales.
